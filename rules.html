      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Drunk Bus Driver Game Rules</h2>
      <p>The game consists of two phases, <i>Hand</i> and <i>Bus</i>.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Phase One: Hand</b></p>
      <p>At the start of the game, there are four face-down cards in front of each player. The task is terribly simple: moving clockwise, one guess awaits each player per turn.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"><b>1.:</b> Will the first card be <b>black</b> or <b><span style="color: red;">red</span></b>?</p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"><b>2.:</b> Will the second card be <b>smaller</b> or <b>larger</b> than the first card?</p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"><b>3.:</b> Will the value of the third card fall <b>between</b> or <b>outside</b> of the values of the two previously flipped cards?</p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"><b>4.:</b> What is the <b>exact</b> value of the fourth card?</p>
      <p style="margin: 30px 10px 10px 30px;"><b><span style="color: red;">LIVER DAMAGE DIFFICULTY:</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;">The color of the fourth card has to be guessed!</p>
      <p>With a correct guess, you can give a sip, while with an incorrect guess, you have to drink a sip of your drink.</p>
      <p style="margin: 30px 10px 10px 30px;"><b><span style="color: red;">LIVER DAMAGE DIFFICULTY:</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;">The number of sips increases with the number of cards: 1-2-3-4. Eg: for flipping the first card you can give a sip if you get it right, but for the second card you can give two sips.</p>
      <p><b><span style="color: blue;">Twist:</span></b> If a player gets a card of the same value as any of his previous cards, the whole squad has to take a sip.</p>
      <p style="margin: 30px 10px 10px 30px;"><b><span style="color: red;">LIVER DAMAGE DIFFICULTY:</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;">Everyone drinks a shot.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Phase Two: Bus</b></p>
      <p>The bus consists of a <b>drinker</b> and a <b>dealer</b> column. Going from the first row, we turn over the drinker and dealer cards. On the bus, the number of <b>seats</b> (rows) is both the number of <b>sips</b> to be allocated and the number of sips to drink. If the value of a card on the bus equals the value of one of the cards in the players' hand, the player either has to drink or give sips. <b>The number of times</b> a card is in that person's hand, you need to <b>multiply</b> the number of sips.</p>
      <p><b>Eg:</b> There are four cards in front of George: 2 - 7 - 7 - K. In the third place of the dealer column, a 7 turns up â€”-> Normally, George would give 3 sips, but he has two sevens, so he can give 3x2 = 6 sips as he pleases.</p>
      <p>It's important to know that sips can <b>be further split</b>, you don't have to give one person 6 sips, you can have three people drink 2 sips and so on.</p>
      <p>As soon as all the drinker and dealer cards are turned over, all that is left is the bus driver.</p>
      <p style="margin: 30px 10px 10px 30px;"><b><span style="color: red;">LIVER DAMAGE DIFFICULTY:</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;">There are two bus drivers.</p>
      <p>Players with a card equal to the value of the bus driver are entitled to optionally <color=red><b>compulsively</b></color> down all the drink in their glass. In the event that the volume of the beverage in the players' glass is <b>not sufficient</b> for a fair drink-downing experience, the squad may <b>vote</b> for a refill.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"><b><span style="color: red;">WARNING!</b></span></p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"><b>RESPONSIBLE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</b> IS VERY IMPORTANT!</p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"><b>DO NOT</b> play this game or drink alcohol under the age of 18!</p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"><b>DO NOT</b> drive under the influence of alcohol.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px;"><b>NO PLAYER</b> should be forced to drink! If a player does not want to participate in the game, it is his decision that other players must respect.</p>
